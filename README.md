# 100-Days-Python
Angela Yu's 100 day python course. These are files that contain my personal assignment challenges and work assigned by her.

Day28: 5th February 2026. I've finally gotten curious and realsied what the .readme file is actually for: providing information about my project, how to install it and how you can contribute to my project.
I wouldn't say it's a single project. I mean It's many projects... For now atleast. Eventually Ill start building professional python projects that will require their own github repo's but untill then,
I'm having fun scratching my head trying to understand Angela's scope logic. She's glazing over concepts like its familiar like the back of her hand. Anyways I'm yappng too hard but this is for the sake of my mental sanity. 
I don't know where exactly I'm headed but Im having fun getting there.
